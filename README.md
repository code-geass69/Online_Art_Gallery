# Online Art Gallery

Welcome to the Online Art Gallery, where art meets technology in a seamless blend of creativity and functionality. As an artist driven by passion, I've crafted a platform that invites art lovers to immerse themselves in a captivating visual journey.
Online Art Gallery is not just a website—it's an aesthetic experience. Built with Node.js, EJS templates, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, this platform showcases my artwork across various categories. Each piece is presented with care to ensure a user-friendly and engaging interaction.
